Dropbox-mnt is a work in progress. My end goal is to have an efficient filesystem which uses caching and goroutines to mount my dropbox account.

==WORKING FEATURES==
config generation
cd and ls... woooo!

==INSTRUCTION==
go get github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/fuse
go get github.com/scottferg/Dropbox-Go/dropbox
go install
./dropbox-mnt MOUNTPATH

==TESTING==
copy your config to test/
run 'go test' inside of test/
